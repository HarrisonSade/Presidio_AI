This article reports on ongoing protests in Nairobi, Kenya, following the death of 31-year-old political blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody on June 8, 2025. Ojwang was arrested on June 6 in Homa Bay after Deputy Police Chief Eliud Lagat filed a defamation complaint against him. Ojwang had criticized Lagat on his blog and linked him to a major corruption scandal. After arrest, Ojwang was transported 400 kilometers to a central Nairobi police station without explanation and found dead two days later.

Police initially claimed Ojwang died by "banging his head against the cell wall," but an autopsy by the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) revealed he died from assault, with head injuries, neck compression, and injuries throughout his body. This was the 20th death in police custody since early 2025. Three people have been arrested for allegedly beating Ojwang at officers' behest, including the police station chief, another officer, and a technician who allegedly disabled surveillance cameras.

Protests began peacefully on June 9 but escalated due to violent police crackdowns, resulting in dozens of arrests and at least one death on June 17 - reportedly a mask vendor killed by police. Police Chief Douglas Kanja publicly apologized for the false suicide claim, blaming "misinformation" from junior colleagues. Deputy Chief Lagat resigned on June 16, calling Ojwang's death an "unfortunate accident" without acknowledging his role.

The incident highlights Kenya's ongoing problem with police violence and extrajudicial killings. Despite President William Ruto's 2022 campaign promises to address these issues, the Kenya Human Rights Commission documented 160 extrajudicial killings by police in 2024. The article references previous protests against tax increases that were violently suppressed by authorities.
