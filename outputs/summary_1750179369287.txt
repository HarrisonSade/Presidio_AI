This news article from Il Globo reports on the fifth day of an escalating military conflict between Israel and Iran dated June 17, 2025. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) announced they eliminated Iran's new Chief of Staff Ali Shadmani, who had recently replaced Alam Ali Rashid after his elimination earlier in the conflict. Shadmani was killed in an Israeli raid on Iranian army headquarters in downtown Tehran. The conflict involves continuous missile exchanges, with Iran launching dozens of ballistic missiles at Israeli cities including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, and Herzliya. Iran claims to have successfully struck the Mossad headquarters in Herzliya and the Israeli military intelligence center (Aman), with Iranian officials stating they used a new missile that Israel failed to intercept.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed that Israeli attacks caused "direct impacts" on the underground portion of Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, a cornerstone of Iran's nuclear program. Israeli military intelligence director General Shlomi Binder announced that operations will expand as part of "Operation Rising Lion," aimed at eliminating Iran's nuclear program and missile capabilities. The IDF reports destroying over 200 ballistic missile launchers and various military targets including missile depots, air defenses, and drone storage sites.

The conflict has caused significant civilian disruption, with thousands fleeing Tehran following a social media warning from U.S. President Donald Trump advising immediate evacuation. The Iranian state television headquarters remains on fire from previous Israeli raids, with three deaths reported. A major cyberattack has disabled Sepah Bank, linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards, wiping out databases and preventing cash withdrawals. President Trump stated that both the U.S. and Israel seek a "real end" to the Iranian nuclear issue, demanding Iran completely abandon its nuclear weapons program.
