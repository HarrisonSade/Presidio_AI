This document reports on the escalating military conflict between Israel and Iran on June 17, 2025, marking the fifth day of direct confrontation. The key development is Israel's elimination of Iran's new Chief of Staff, Ali Shadmani, who had recently replaced Alam Ali Rashid (also killed earlier in the operation). Shadmani was a close adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and commanded both the Pasdaran (Revolutionary Guards) and Tehran's regular army.

The conflict involves extensive missile exchanges, with Iran launching dozens of ballistic missiles at Israeli cities including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa, and Herzliya. Iran claims to have successfully struck the Mossad headquarters in Herzliya and the military intelligence center Aman, using new missiles that allegedly evaded Israeli interception systems. Israel's Operation Rising Lion continues with expanded strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, missile depots, and military infrastructure. The IAEA has confirmed "direct impacts" on the underground portion of Iran's Natanz nuclear site, a cornerstone of Iran's nuclear program.

Israeli forces report destroying over 200 ballistic missile launchers and hitting multiple targets including the Iranian state TV headquarters (IRIB), which caught fire with three reported deaths. A major cyber attack has also disabled Iranian banks linked to the Revolutionary Guards, particularly Sepah Bank. The humanitarian situation is deteriorating with thousands fleeing Tehran following President Trump's evacuation warning. Trump has indicated the US and Israel seek a "real end" to the Iranian nuclear issue, demanding Iran completely abandon its nuclear weapons program. Israeli military intelligence head General Shlomi Binder has confirmed operations will expand further.
