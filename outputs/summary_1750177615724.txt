This document reports on ongoing protests in Nairobi, Kenya, following the death of 31-year-old political blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody. Ojwang, who had criticized Deputy Police Chief Eliud Lagat on his blog and linked him to corruption scandals, was arrested on June 6 in Homa Bay on defamation charges. He was transported 400 kilometers to a Nairobi police station where he was found dead two days later.

Initially, police claimed Ojwang died by "banging his head against the cell wall," but this was quickly disproven. An autopsy by the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) revealed head injuries, neck compression, and diffuse injuries across his body, indicating assault. This marks the 20th such death in police custody since early 2025.

Protests began peacefully on June 9 but escalated due to violent police crackdowns, resulting in dozens of arrests and at least one death on June 17 - reportedly a mask vendor killed by police. Three individuals have been arrested for allegedly beating Ojwang at officers' behest, including the police station chief, another officer, and a technician accused of disabling surveillance cameras. Other officers on duty were suspended.

Police Chief Douglas Kanja publicly apologized for the false suicide claim, blaming misinformation from subordinates. Deputy Police Chief Lagat resigned on June 16, calling Ojwang's death an "unfortunate accident" without acknowledging his role in the arrest. The document notes systemic police violence remains problematic in Kenya despite President William Ruto's 2022 election promises, with 160 extrajudicial killings by police documented in 2024 and additional deaths during tax increase protests.
