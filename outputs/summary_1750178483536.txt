This article reports on ongoing protests in Nairobi, Kenya, following the death of 31-year-old political blogger Albert Ojwang while in police custody on June 8, 2025. Ojwang had been arrested on June 6 in Homa Bay after Deputy Police Chief Eliud Lagat filed a defamation complaint against him. On his blog, Ojwang had repeatedly criticized Lagat and linked him to a major corruption scandal. Following his arrest, Ojwang was transported 400 kilometers to a central Nairobi police station without explanation and was found dead two days later.

Initially, police claimed Ojwang died by "banging his head against the cell wall," but this was quickly deemed false. An autopsy by the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) revealed Ojwang had suffered head injuries, neck compression, and diffuse injuries across his body, indicating death by assault. The IPOA has arrested three people accused of beating Ojwang at officers' behest, along with the police station chief, another officer, and a technician who allegedly turned off surveillance cameras.

Protests began peacefully on June 9 but escalated due to violent police crackdowns, resulting in dozens of arrests and at least one death on June 17 - reportedly a mask vendor killed by police. Police Chief Douglas Kanja publicly apologized for the false suicide claim, blaming misinformation from junior colleagues. Deputy Police Chief Lagat resigned on June 16, calling Ojwang's death an "unfortunate accident" without acknowledging his role.

The article notes this represents the 20th death in police custody since early 2025. Systemic violence and extrajudicial killings by Kenyan police remain problematic despite President William Ruto's 2022 election promises to address them. The Kenya Human Rights Commission documented 160 extrajudicial police killings in 2024.
